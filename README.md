Tely 10 Race Dashboard Web Application

Created using Dash

This is a web application dashboard, which contains 4 different visualizations.

First visualization represents the total number of participants in the Tely 10 Race throughout the last 15 years, as well as the total number of male and female participants each year.

The second visualization is a histogram that represents the different in measurements (in terms of time) between the chip record time of a participant, and the gun time record. This is an interactive visualization with a dropdown menu to select the specific year or to visualize the data for all the years combined.

The third visualization is a bar plot representing the top 10 participants each year with their respective times obtained. This visualization is also an interactive visualization with a dropdown menu to select the specific year to visualize, or to visualize the top 10 participants throughout the last 15 years.

The fourth visualization is a line plot indicating the best time achieved in the race each year for both men and women.
